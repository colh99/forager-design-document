# Forager Design Document

In CSE 430 Architectural Design, our class of 12 was tasked with creating a Software Design Document for an applicaton over the course of a semester. The document contains an in-depth design for a mobile application we chose that would assist users in identifying useful plants in their area. It contains over 100 design views of varying complexity.

## My contributions to this project

I worked on the Server (backend) team, contributing to the design of the server application.

In addition to the QA Chief (Ashley DeMott), each team had assigned a member to handle quality assurance for all tasks within their team, and I fulfilled this role for the Server team.

## How to access the document
